### What I learned

- How to write gradient variables in SCSS: $gradientOne: linear-gradient(135deg, hsl(0, 0%, 100%), hsl(0, 100%, 98%));

- â€¢ Remember how to increase the size of the fas : <i class="formContainer__icon fa fa-envelope fa-2x"></i>

- â€¢ Stay away from using nextElementSibling: is not precise enough to target the right html element use querySelector instead

```



```

### Continued development

I would like to continue studying responsive SCSS specially with Grid + Flexbox and CSS animation, transitions and FX like parallax.
